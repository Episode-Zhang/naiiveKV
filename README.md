# 介绍

该项目是一个简易的支持增删改查的数据库demo，也是作者本人的毕业设计。因时间与作者水平的限制，一些常规的数据库功能，例如对事务的支持、并发读写、日志的备份与数据恢复等功能并没有进行实现。

该项目使用**IntelliJ IDEA**开发，程序的运行环境是命令行环境，入口处在`src/Main/Main`类中。运行程序时，可以输入`help`命令来查看该简易数据库demo所支持的操作，也可以使用在项目根目录创建目录`data`后，使用命令`load demo`来加载预置的数据集。

# Description

This project is a simple database demo that supports CRUD operations and was developed as the author's graduation project. Due to time constraints and the author's coding ability, some standard database features, such as transaction support, concurrent read and write, and log backup and data recovery, were not implemented.

The project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and runs in a command line environment. The entry point of the program is the `src/Main/Main` class. When running the program, you can type `help` in the command prompt to view the supported operations of the database demo. Additionally, after creating the `data` directory in the project root, you can use the `load demo` command to load the preset dataset.
